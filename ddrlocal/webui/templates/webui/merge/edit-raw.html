<p>
Conflicted files contain one or more sections that look something like this:
</p>
<pre><code>    ...
    {
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD&#x000A;        "description": "This is one description of the collection."
    },
    {
        "notes": "These notes were written by one person."
=======
        "description": "This is an alternate description of the collection."
    },
    {
        "notes": "These notes were written by someone else."
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; iss53
    },
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>
The text between <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</code> and <code>=======</code> represents one version, and the text between <code>=======</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; iss53</code> represents another (Note: the <code>iss53</code> is an auto-generated marker; you will see other text in its place).
In order to resolve the conflict, you have to either choose one side or the other or merge the contents yourself.
</p>
<p>
For instance, you might resolve this conflict by choosing the first block like this:
</p>
<pre><code>    ...
    {
        "description": "This is one description of the collection."
    },
    {
        "notes": "These notes were written by one person."
    },
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>
Or you might resolve this conflict by replacing the entire block with a little of each section:
</p>
<pre><code>    ...
    {
        "description": "This is a combination of two descriptions of the collection."
    },
    {
        "notes": "These notes were collaboratively written by two people."
    },
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>
In each case the <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>=======</code>, and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> lines have been fully removed.
</p>
<p>
After youâ€™ve resolved each of these sections in each conflicted file, click "Submit" to mark it as resolved.
